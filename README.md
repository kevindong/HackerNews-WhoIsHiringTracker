# Hacker News - Who Is Hiring Tracker

**NOTE: This is a work in progress.**

Y Combinator's Hacker News has a monthly "Who Is Hiring" thread. However, there is no option to sort the job postings on that thread by time posted. As a result, it's **very** easy to miss new job postings. This script aims to solve that problem.

## Instructions

You may need to install the `requests` library. The easiest way is to run `pip install requests`. Obviously, you'll also need to have Python installed. 

To use this script, just open up terminal, `cd` into the appropriate directory, and then type `python Tracker.py`.
